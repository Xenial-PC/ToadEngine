# TOADEngine
TOAD – Transform, Optimize, Animate, Deploy  

Toad Engine is built to mimic the layout and structure of Unity as thats what I know best.  

TODO:  
Write Game Engine Docs  

Improve graphics:   
Point Shadows   
HDR Pipeline,  
Bloom,  
Deffered Shading or Forward+,  
SSAO  

Work further on Sample Game -> Simple Platformer  

Warning: This project isnt perfect, this is a learning process for me to get better at game developement and learning how game engines work in the background.  
I have taken some shortcuts when it comes to Physics, and UI. I felt like it wasnt worth re-inventing the wheel after I learned the basics behind it.  

Hopefully anyone who stumbles upon this project will find it as a learning experience as much as I have so far. If you have any comments on what I can improve feel free to leave a PR.  
Thanks! -
